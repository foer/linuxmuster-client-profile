linuxmuster-client-profile (0.1-precise3) linuxmuster-client; urgency=low

  * initial release
  * Fixed typo in control file
  * First working script, very raw, but the default users profile gets copied
  * Moved profile-user-check to linuxmuster-client-shares
    linuxmuster-pam-mount
  * from sourced file has to be returned, exit leaves the whole process without
    mounting the shares. Fixed this.
